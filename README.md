Cervical Spine Fracture Detection
Introduction
Cervical spine fractures are serious injuries that require timely detection and intervention. This project introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to detect cervical spine fractures and localize them to specific vertebrae (C1-C7). By automating this process, the model aims to support healthcare professionals in reducing diagnostic errors and improving efficiency.
